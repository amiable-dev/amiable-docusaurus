In this post, we'll explore how to use Claude Desktop with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) GitHub Server to manage repository changes effectively. We'll use our recent implementation of AI metadata in Docusaurus as a practical example.

## Understanding MCP GitHub Server

The Model Context Protocol GitHub Server provides an interface for AI models to interact with GitHub repositories. Key features include:

- Repository management
- Branch creation and updates
- File operations
- Issue and PR management

## Claude Desktop Capabilities

Claude Desktop can:

✅ **Can Do**:
- Create and manage GitHub issues
- Create and switch branches
- Create and update files
- Generate pull requests
- Provide code reviews and suggestions
- Handle multiple files and changes
- Follow repository structure conventions

❌ **Cannot Do**:
- Directly merge pull requests
- Delete repositories or branches
- Access private repositories without proper setup
- Handle binary files or large assets
- Execute commands on your system

## Practical Example: AI Metadata Implementation

Let's look at how we used Claude Desktop with MCP to implement our AI metadata feature:

### 1. Issue Creation

```typescript
// Creating an issue via MCP
create_issue({
  title: "Add AI metadata components",
  body: "Detailed requirements and tasks...",
  labels: ["enhancement"],
  repo: "amiable-docusaurus",
  owner: "amiable-dev"
});
```

### 2. Branch Management

```typescript
// Creating a feature branch
create_branch({
  repo: "amiable-docusaurus",
  owner: "amiable-dev",
  branch: "feature/ai-metadata-component"
});
```

### 3. File Operations

```typescript
// Creating/updating files
push_files({
  repo: "amiable-docusaurus",
  owner: "amiable-dev",
  branch: "feature/ai-metadata-component",
  files: [{
    path: "src/theme/BlogPost/Header/AIMetadata/index.tsx",
    content: "// Component code..."
  }],
  message: "Add AI metadata component"
});
```

## Best Practices

1. **Branch Management**
   - Create descriptive branch names
   - Branch from the correct parent
   - Keep changes focused

2. **Commit Organization**
   - Write clear commit messages
   - Group related changes
   - Include context where needed

3. **Error Handling**
   - Handle API limitations gracefully
   - Retry failed operations
   - Provide clear error messages

4. **Documentation**
   - Document process flows
   - Explain configuration requirements
   - Include examples

## Common Challenges and Solutions

1. **API Rate Limits**
   - Use batched operations
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Add retry logic

2. **Branch Management**
   - Verify branch existence
   - Check parent branches
   - Handle conflicts

3. **File Operations**
   - Handle encoding correctly
   - Validate content types
   - Check file sizes

## Workflow Tips

1. **Planning**
   - Break down tasks
   - Create clear issues
   - Define success criteria

2. **Implementation**
   - Use proper branching
   - Commit logically
   - Test thoroughly

3. **Review**
   - Check generated code
   - Verify documentation
   - Test functionality

## Example Workflow

1. Create an issue:
```bash
# Using MCP GitHub Server
create_issue({
  title: "Feature implementation",
  body: "Requirements and tasks"
});
```

2. Create a feature branch:
```bash
create_branch({
  branch: "feature/new-feature"
});
```

3. Make changes:
```bash
push_files({
  files: [/* file changes */],
  message: "Implement feature"
});
```

4. Create PR:
```bash
create_pull_request({
  title: "Add new feature",
  body: "Description and context"
});
```

## Conclusion

Using Claude Desktop with MCP GitHub Server provides a powerful way to manage repository changes. Key takeaways:

1. Understand capabilities and limitations
2. Follow best practices
3. Handle errors gracefully
4. Document thoroughly

This approach has helped us maintain clean repository history and efficient development workflows. The AI metadata implementation serves as a practical example of how these tools can work together effectively.
