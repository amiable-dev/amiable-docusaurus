This is a test post to demonstrate the AI metadata display component in action. The component should appear at the top of this post, showing details about the AI models and tools used in its creation.

<!--truncate-->

## Component Testing

This post helps us verify several aspects of the AI metadata display:

### 1. Metadata Display

The component should show:
- Which AI models were used (Claude and GPT-4)
- The specific tasks each model performed
- Confidence scores for each model
- Tools used in the creation process
- The review process
- Quality metrics

### 2. Styling

We can verify:
- Dark/light mode compatibility
- Responsive design
- Typography consistency
- Tooltip functionality

### 3. Integration

This post confirms:
- Proper swizzling of the BlogPostItem component
- Correct front matter parsing
- Type safety for metadata fields

## Example Code

Here's a code snippet to test syntax highlighting:

```typescript
interface AIModel {
  name: string;
  version: string;
  tasks?: string[];
  confidence_score?: number;
}

const model: AIModel = {
  name: "Claude 3.5 Sonnet",
  version: "20241022",
  tasks: ["content", "code"],
  confidence_score: 0.95
};
```

## Testing Markdown Features

1. **Bold text** and *italic text*
2. [Links to documentation](https://docusaurus.io)
3. > Blockquotes for important notes
4. Tables for structured data:

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Metadata Display | ✅ |
| Dark Mode | ✅ |
| Tooltips | ✅ |
| Responsive | ✅ |

## Next Steps

- [ ] Gather feedback on the metadata display
- [ ] Consider adding more interactive features
- [ ] Implement analytics tracking
- [ ] Add more customization options

## Conclusion

This test post demonstrates that our AI metadata display component is working as expected, providing transparency about AI involvement in content creation while maintaining a clean and professional appearance.

You can examine the source of this post to see how the metadata is structured in the front matter.
